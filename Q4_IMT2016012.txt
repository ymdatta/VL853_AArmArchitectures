Q4: Can we do nested IF-THEN-ELSE in Cortex-M4?
A: No.

If we look in the IT Section of [1] (section: 3.10.3),
under restrictions we find that the following instructions
are not permitted inside IT block.

-> IT
-> CBZ and CBNZ
-> CPSID and CPSIE

Hence, we cannot do nested IF-THEN-ELSE in Cortex-M4.
